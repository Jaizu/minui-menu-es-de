# MinUI Menu for ES-DE

This is a tranlation of the MinUI menu interface (originally designed & created by [Shaun Inman](https://github.com/shauninman/)) for ES-DE.

My work focused on tranlating the layout so that it could be buildable in the theme engine for ES-DE.  Please refer to the `Changes Made` section below for additional details. 

The original version of UI can be found as part of the awesome MinUI custom firmware [here](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).

## Changes Made

- Used [MinUI screenshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shauninman/MinUI/main/github/minui-main.png) to approximate the components that would be used build a theme compatible with ES-DE.
- Changed the helpsystem ES-DE's and created a layout that tries to evoke the original helpsystem design (sadly it can't be a 1:1 translation due to differences in the theme engines)
- Added icons and badges specific to ES-DE functionality
- Added a framework for adding additional color schemes and added Light and Dark options to start
- Added Bold and Non-Bold font options

## **Configuration Options**

The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 

### **Color Schemes:**

- `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views.
   - `Dark` - The default color scheme. 
   - `Light` - A `light` version of the above color scheme.
 
| Dark | Light |
|----|----|

### **Font Sizes:**

- `Theme Font Size` - sets the size that text will render at. This can be helpful when using the theme on small screens.
   - Supported Font Sizes:
   - `Medium` - Default size, good for small handheld screens under 6 inches in size.
   - `Large` - Good for small handheld screens under 4 inches in size.
   - `Small` - Smaller size, good for larger screens.

### **Aspect Ratios:**

- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio to match your display. This should happen automatically but can also be set manually if needed.
   - Supported Aspect Ratios:
   - `4:3`
   - `16:9`
   - `16:10`
   - `3:2`
   - `19.5:9`
   - `1:1`
 
## Additional Notes

### **Creating a custom color scheme:**

1) In [colors.xml](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/miniui-menu-es-de/blob/main/colors.xml) you will see these properties at the end of the file:
   ```
   <colorScheme name="custom">
      <variables>
         <backgroundTile>true</backgroundTile>
         <backgroundPath>${spacerImage}</backgroundPath>
         <backgroundColor>000000</backgroundColor>
         <textlistFont>./_inc/fonts/BPreplayBold.otf</textlistFont>
         <textlistSelectedColor>000000</textlistSelectedColor>
         <textlistSelectedBackgroundColor>F7FBF7</textlistSelectedBackgroundColor>
         <textlistUnselectedColor>F7FBF7</textlistUnselectedColor>
         <helpsystemFont>default</helpsystemFont>
         <helpsystemLetterCase>uppercase</helpsystemLetterCase>
         <helpsystemIconColor>454e45</helpsystemIconColor>
         <helpsystemTextColor>F7FBF7</helpsystemTextColor>
         <helpsystemBackgroundColor>000000</helpsystemBackgroundColor>
         <badgeIconColor>454e45</badgeIconColor>
      </variables>
   </colorScheme>
   ```
   
2) Definition of each property:
   - `backgroundTile` - Sets if the background image should be repeated (aka tiled) or not.  Allowed values are `true` or `false`
   - `backgroundPath` - Sets the path to an image to use for the background.  The default is a spacer image that can be used to create solid color backgrounds when used in combination with the next property.  However you can also set full screen images instead.
   - `backgroundColor` - Sets the color to be used for the background on all screens.  If you are using a fullscreen image its best to set this to `ffffff` so that the original image's colors will display.
   - `textlistFont` - The font that will be used for the system and game list.  You can use the built in font by leaving the value as is or change it to point to a custom font file that you supply.
   - `textlistSelectedColor` - Sets the text color for the selected item in the list
   - `textlistSelectedBackgroundColor` - Sets the highlight color for the selected item in the list
   - `textlistUnselectedColor` - Sets the text color for unselected items in the list
   - `helpsystemFont` - The font that will be used to display text in the included help system.  You can use the built in font by leaving the value as is or change it to point to a custom font file that you supply.
   - `helpsystemLetterCase` - Sets the lettercase that is used for text in the included help system.  Allowed values are `lowercase`, `uppercase` or `capitalize`
   - `helpsystemIconColor` - Sets the icon color for items in the included help system
   - `helpsystemTextColor` - Sets the text color for items in the included help system
   - `helpsystemBackgroundColor` - Sets the background color for the included help system.  You can make this transparent by setting the value to `00000000`
   - `badgeIconColor` - Sets the icon color for badges (Favorite, Completed, Collections, etc.) displayed on the gamelist view.
  
4) Changing the values for each property should allow you to create any number of color schemes.  Here are some examples:

| "Pocket Micro" | "Pocket DMG" |
|----|----|

4) If you make a custom color scheme and are comfortable with sharing I would love to check it out ðŸ˜Š
   - Please feel free to create an issue in this repo called `Custom Color Scheme: [Name of your Color Scheme]`
   - Include the values you used for the properties above (xml is preferred), the background image and fonts you added (if any) and a screenshot of what it looks like.
